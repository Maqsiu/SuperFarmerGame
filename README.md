# SuperFarmerGame
A simple implementation of the SuperFarmer board game written in C#. The game follows the original rules, featuring animal breeding, trading, and random events.

Game Rules
- Each player starts with a small herd of animals.

- On each turn, the player rolls two dice to determine animal reproduction.

- Animals of the same type can reproduce and increase the herd.

- Players can trade animals according to a fixed exchange rate (e.g., 6 rabbits = 1 sheep).

- Predators (foxes and wolves) may appear and reduce the herd unless the player has a small or large dog for protection.

- The goal is to collect at least one of each type of animal (rabbit, sheep, pig, cow, horse).
